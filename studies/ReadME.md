| `instar analysis`           | Analyses to quantify and estimate the properties of snow crab instars from size data.                        |
| `female instar stage model` | Stage-structured population models for female snow crab divided by instars and sexual maturity.              | 
| `females size-based model`  | Size-structured population models for female snow crab divided by instars and sexual maturity.               | 
| `size-based TMB`            | Size-structured modelling framework in Template Model Builder (TMB).                                         |
| `miscellaneous`             | Archived population modelling programs and background materials.                                             |
| `U de M`                    | Population modelling project with the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Unversit√© de Moncton.         |
