# Size and instar-based population modelling

## Background

Female snow crab to 11 benthic instars, i.e. they moult up to 11 times before attaining sexual maturity at the terminal moult.
Benthic instars are numbered using roman numerals from **I** to **XI**. Each instar can be grouped into one of four maturity stages:

| Stage       | Description                                                               |
| ----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| immature    | Morphometrically **immature** with small **white**-coloured gonads.       |
| pubescent   | Morphometrically **immature** with larger **orange**-coloured gonads.     |
| primiparous | Morphometrically **mature** with **New-shell** carapace condition.        |
| multiparous | Morphometrically **mature** with **Old-shell** carapace condition.        |

The immature maturity stage lasts from instar **I** up to instar **IX**. Immature instars **VII**, **VIII** and **IX** can then transition to the pubescent maturity stages as instars 
**VIII**, **IX** and **X**, respectively. Pubsecent instars **VIII**, **IX** and **X** then transition to primiparous instars **IX**, **X** and **XI** during the following terminal moult, respectively. 
Primiparous and multiparous females have attained full sexual maturity and longer moult. Primparous females are identified as multiparous females the following year. Females remain
multiparous for the remainder of the lives.

Note : The working definition of primiparous females used here refers to females which have new shells, i.e. have moulted within the current survey year. Females carrying their first
clutch of eggs for a second year, as part of a two-year incubation cycle, would be classified as multiparous under the above definitions.

The global maturity-stage can be represented as the following diagram:

where arrows represent annual increments of time.

The global maturity-stage can be broken down into instars, as in the following diagram:
